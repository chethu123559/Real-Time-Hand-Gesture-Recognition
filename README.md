# Real-Time-Hand-Gesture-Recognition
This project demonstrates a real-time hand gesture recognition system using a webcam feed. It utilizes Google MediaPipe Hands for landmark detection and OpenCV for video processing and visualization. The system recognizes a set of predefined static gestures such as Open Palm, Fist, Peace Sign, and Thumbs Up.
