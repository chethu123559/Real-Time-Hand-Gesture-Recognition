#  Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition using MediaPipe & OpenCV

This project demonstrates a **real-time hand gesture recognition system** using a webcam feed.  
It utilizes **Google MediaPipe Hands** for landmark detection and **OpenCV** for video processing and visualization.  
The system recognizes a set of predefined static gestures such as **Open Palm, Fist, Peace Sign, and Thumbs Up**.
